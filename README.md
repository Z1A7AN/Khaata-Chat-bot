# React + Vite

Chatbot using React with CDN in an HTML, Users can input messages using an input field, and when they click the "Send" button, their message is added to the list of messages, and a simulated bot response is added after a short delay. This is a very basic chatbot implementation and can be expanded with more sophisticated logic and features as needed

I have created a simple chat application using ReactJS and Tailwindcss.
